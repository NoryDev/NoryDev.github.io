<p class="lead" markdown="1">I’m Fabien Loup. I'm a Software Developer at Pisano where I deal with the Rails API and mess around the AngularJS client.</p>

Prior to that, I was a freelance software developer and mostly worked with Belgian team mates for Belgian customers. A long time ago, I graduated and then worked as an Electronics Engineer in my home country, Switzerland.

I currently live with my wonderful wife in Istanbul, Turkey and work for [Pisano](http://www.pisano.co), a Turkish company that builds a Customer Feedback Software.

I like to [Hitchhike](https://www.somewherexpress.com) around Europe with my friends. If you are also a Hitchhiker or traveler and want a bed in Istanbul, contact me on [Trustroots](https://www.trustroots.org/profile/redfox).

I'm norydev on the Internets. As people ask me what “norydev” means: it's an anagram of my [hometown](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yverdon-les-Bains).
