<p class="lead" markdown="1">I’m Fabien Loup. I'm a Senior Ruby Developer at Silverfin.</p>

Prior to that, I worked for Pisano, a software company in Istanbul. Before that I was a freelance software developer and mostly worked with Belgian team mates for Belgian customers. A long time ago, I graduated and then worked as an Electronics Engineer in my home country, Switzerland.

I currently work for [Silverfin](https://www.silverfin.com/en), a company that provides many useful tools for Accounting firms. Since I work remotely, and my wife and I aren't sure about where to live, we are moving around Europe at the moment.

I like to [Hitchhike](https://www.somewherexpress.com) around Europe with my friends. If you are also a Hitchhiker or traveler and want a bed in Istanbul, contact me on [Trustroots](https://www.trustroots.org/profile/redfox).

I'm norydev on the Internets. As people ask me what “norydev” means: it's an anagram of my [hometown](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yverdon-les-Bains).
